## Features

* **Geofence Management**

  * Define virtual boundaries using interactive maps (MapKit & CoreLocation).
  * Detect when attendees enter or exit designated zones.

* **E-Pass Authentication**

  * Generate and activate digital passes with biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID).

* **Real-Time Tracking**

  * Continuously monitor user movement and location for dynamic updates.

* **iOS-Optimized UI**

  * Built using Swift and SwiftUI/UIKit with responsive design for smooth interaction.

* **Backend Integration**

  * Communicates with APIs to synchronize attendee data securely.
